# SimplePuzzleGame

Developed within a 2-week constraint, this simple turn-based Sokoban-style game in Unity (C#) offers modular components with entanglement-like behavior and interaction between objects of different types/colors. The game supports built-in levels as well as custom levels created in the in-game level editor, which features intuitive 'painting' tools for level design.

Controls:

WASD/Arrows/Numpad : Move Player/s</br>
Z: Undo last move</br>
R: Restart level</br>
